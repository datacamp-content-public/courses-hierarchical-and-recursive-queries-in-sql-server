In this chapter we will learn the basics about hierarchical queries. To do this, we have at first to give a look in detail about the basics of hierarchical data and data structures

## What is a hierarchy?

```yaml
type: "FullImageSlide"
key: "d7e91f423e"
```

`@part1`
> A **hierarchy** is an arrangement of **items** 
(objects, names, values, categories, etc.) in which the items are represented as being "**above**", "**below**", or "at the same level as" one another.
_from Wikipedia_

`@script`
In general, if we are taking about hierarchy we are talking about an arrangement of items which are connected in an ordered way. Accordingly, one item has one item above, below or on the same level. I think the moste obvious example therefore is the organization of a company, where each employee has his boss or the bill of materials, where a car is built by different parts as an engine or the body of the car

## Present hierarchy as a tree

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "338146a1c2"
disable_transition: false
```

`@script`
Here we want to talk about how we could present a tree in general and how the tree of an hierarchy is define. In the presented pictures we can see 3 different examples of a data structure. the most right one connected to each other, the middle one has separted connections and the left one. The question now is, what structure as presented here relates to a tree?

## Present hierarchy as a tree

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "51763f7ea7"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
- Each child record has only one parent.
- Each parent record can have one or more child records.

`@script`
The answer is the left one. The left one represents a hierarchy. The explanation is that this structures that each item has only connections below, above and on the same level, each child has only one parent and each parent has one or more child. This definition is not only valid for the middle and the right data structure. Here the items a interconnected to each other as in the right picture and we have several parents which are not connected to each other as in the middle pictures.
