In this chapter we will learn the basics about hierarchical queries. To do this, we have at first to learn the basics of hierarchical data and its data structures

## What is a hierarchy?

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "7f8eebcd79"
```

`@part1`
> A **hierarchy** is an arrangement of **items**  in which the items are represented as being "**above**", "**below**", or "at the same level as" one another.
_from Wikipedia_

`@script`
In general, if we are thinking about hierarchy we are talking about an arrangement of items which are connected in an ordered way. Accordingly, one item has one item above, below or on the same level. I think the moste obvious example therefore is the organization of a company, where each employee has its boss or the bill of materials, where a car is built up by different parts like an engine or the body of the car. The question is now how the items are arranged to each other? Are all connected to each other? Has one item only one item above or below?

## How to represent hierarchy?

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "338146a1c2"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/64b5ed02c0f1ff079c3d1779faaa6d13c4bfeec7/differentStructures.png)


`@script`
To answer these questions, we want to talk about how we could present a tree in general and how the tree of an hierarchy is defined. In the presented pictures we can see 3 different examples of a data structure. The right one is connected to each other, the middle one has separated connections and the left one has its presented structure. The question is now, which structure represents a tree as a hierarchy?

## How to represent hierarchy?

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "51763f7ea7"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
- Each child item has only one parent.
- Each parent item can have one or more child items.

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/36906347a2c4fb68d4de6c053410229d3d4924d0/compareStructure.png)


`@script`
The answer is the left one. The left one represents a hierarchy. The explanation therefore is that each item has only connections below, above and on the same level, each child has only one parent and each parent has one or more child. This definition is not valid for the middle and the right data structure. In the right picture the items are interconnected to each other and in the middle picture we have several parents which are not connected to each other. The right structure represents a general network as we know it for example in a telecommunication network and the middle picture could be viewed as a market representation with several members and their companies and products. Next we will look at an example in more detail

## Hierarchy as relational tables

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "4bf0f32e18"
```

`@part1`
Employee table

`@part2`
Department table

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/b383c725088326df4608f452a830ade169bee292/DeptTable.png){{2}}


`@script`
At first we will use general relational algebra, where we have connecting keys for belonging tables. Here we can see one table for employees and one for the department. What we want to know is the relation between employee and manager. Which employee has which manager.

## Hierarchy as relational tables

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "ea6dac5e1d"
```

`@part1`
Both tables:

`@part2`
Joined table:

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/3fb97f690c130f38c1d43ead69f1585b283d9827/joinedDataOrg.png){{1}}

- Two tables needed {{2}}
- Join operation needed {{2}}


`@script`
This could be done by joining the two tables. The result are presented and you can see that for example Heinz Grie√üer has John Smith as Manager. What have we learned now? By using relational algebra, we need two tables and the join operation to get the hierarchy. Next we will create a tree structure for hierarchical data.

## Hierarchy as tree structure model

```yaml
type: "TwoRows"
key: "44bf2eb3b5"
```

`@part1`
Organization relation as tree

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/f51ce7c6f4f91e82eaf38c420d405a40a1445d07/empAsTree.png){{1}}


`@part2`
Advantages: {{2}}

- One table {{3}}
- Inexpensive querying {{3}}
- Recursive querying with "with-query" {{3}}


`@script`
By using now the definition for a tree to present a hierarchy, we have to modify the table. As presented we have one table with the relation to its hierarchy inside. Now we can see for each item (except the director Mara Simpson) has its father and accordingly the hierarchy is presented. For example Andreas Sitter has a manager with the id 236 and the manager with the id 236 is Paul Walker. So Paul Walker is the boss of Andreas Sitter. Representing the hierarchy in this way has advantages. We have only one table, querying is inexpensive and we can use recursive querying which we will learn in detail in the next exercises.
We have heard a lot how to create a hierarchical table, but we want to know when we should use them and when not!

## Why to use hierarchical data?

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "624d1a774e"
```

`@part1`
**Advantages:**
- **Supported** in **common** SQL database {{1}}
- Each node is visited **twice**: querying is **inexpensive** {{1}}
- **Higher** performance {{1}}
- **No additional** tables are needed {{1}}


`@part2`
**Disadvantages:**

- **No complex relational** data is present{{2}}
- Data is **not often changing** {{2}}
- **Slow** for **inserting** steps because the entire table has to be updated {{2}}


`@script`
We want at first to talk about the advantages. In common sql databases hierarchical structures are supported. Accordingly, querying this tables is fast and inexpensive. We have to query one table in which the information is represented by two values. Due to the fact that we only need one table there is also no need for a table representing the relation between items! If we are now thinking about the disadvantages, we have to consider that the presented data is not changing often. Modifying hierarchical tables by for example inserting a new item, the whole table has to be updated. Each number representing the items' hierarchy has to be modified. Moreover, it is useful not to represent too complex data with hierarchical trees. In this situation it is better to establish a foreign key table relationship as in the previous example

## Let's practise

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "9126dc415d"
```

`@script`
So, we have heard a lot about hierarchical data and when we should use them and when we should not use them. In the following exercises you have to answer several questions to prove your understanding of hierarchical data.
