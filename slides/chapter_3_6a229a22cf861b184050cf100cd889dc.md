`@script`
In the last exercise we have learned how to use recursive queries and why it is beneficial to use the use technique to improve your queries and their efficiency. Now we want to learn, how we could use the this technique to query the IT organisation of a new start-up called "DataInsigthNow"


---
## The IT organizaiotn

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a1afd32cd9"
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/db04da806342ebb645063f6bc6822e5b4fa0e6d1/ITorganigramm.png)


`@script`
Here you can see the organigramm of the company "DataInsightNow". We have created this organigram in the last exercices and is saved in the table "EMPLOYEE" This table is organized by the IT Director, the managment level with security manager,Operation Manger, Service Manager and so on  and the level of technicians, administrators and developers.


---
## Query the table "EMPLOYEE"

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "d7c74aa8af"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
```sql
DESC EMPLOYEE
```


`@script`
With the knowledge of the organigramm of the company we want now to check the table "EMPLOYEE" where each employee and the organisation is saved. This we can do by use the command DESC. Applying this command on the table employee you can see that the table is organized by an ID, the name of the person, the job title and the ID of the employee's supervisor


---
## Query the table "Employee"

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "d5a47e5815"
```

`@part1`
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
```


`@script`
Next we want to check the data, we select all to get the table with its entries. As you can see we have here several entries of employes. What we now want to do is, to query the  table to get the employees hierarchy levels of the IT-organigramm


---
## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "3d7930f567"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
Get the hierarchical level for each employee
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id, Name, JobTitle, Level, Supervisor) AS 
(
      SELECT
            Id, Name, JobTitle, 0, Supervisor
      FROM
           Employee
      WHERE 
            Manager IS NULL
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT
            emp.Id, emp.Name, emp.JobTitle, Level + 1, emp. Supervisor
      FROM
            dbo.Employee emp
      INNER JOIN OrganisationChart ON 
            emp.Supervisor = OrganisationChart.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy
ORDER BY Level
	
```


`@script`
To do this we use the with-query select as learned before. We create the CLT hierarchy with the union of the employees with no Manager with all other employess of the table Employee. You can see now the query. With the entry level we get the hierachy level of all employees


---
## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "3bd48d26d7"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
The query result:


`@script`
The result of the query looks as shon . Each employee has its supervisor and its hierarchical level. 3 has 5 as boss, 7 has 2 and so.  This knowledge is very usefull, but now we want to query all employess managed my an specific employee.


---
## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "1204caa93e"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
Get all employees with the supervisor 5
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id, Name, JobTitle, Level, Supervisor, Root) AS
(     SELECT
            Id, Name, JobTitle, 0, Supervisor, Id
      FROM
            dbo.Employee
      WHERE 
            Manager IS NULL
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT
            emp.Id, 
emp.Name, 
emp.JobTitle, 
Level + 1, 
emp.Supervisor, 
Root
      FROM
            dbo.Employee emp
      INNER JOIN OrganisationChart ON 
            emp.Supervisor = hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy WHERE Root = 11
```


`@script`
To do so we have to modify the query as described here. We add the value root which corresponds to the top-most supervior of each employee. Doing so, we can now query all employees managed by the employee with ROOT ID 5


---
## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "5ff2e3007b"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
The query result:


`@script`
This results in the following output. You can see that the employee 5 has 6 employees to manage.


---
## Let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "97121459e2"
```

`@script`
Now you have seen, how we could create queries for hierarchical organisations and now it is to practise this new knowledge. Have fun!
