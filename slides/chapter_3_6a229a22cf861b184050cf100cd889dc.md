`@script`
In the last exercise we have learned how to use recursive queries and why it is beneficial to use the technique of CTL and hierarchical queries to improve your queries and their efficiency. Now we want to learn, how we could use  this technique to query the IT organisation of a new start-up called "DataInsigthNow"


---
## The IT Organization

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "a1afd32cd9"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/890cf714460580b2f17d84962adc1a08e5effd04/ITorganigramm.png)


`@script`
The organigramm of the company "DataInsightNow" is described as shown. We have created this organigram in the last exercices and is saved in the table "EMPLOYEE". This table is organized by the IT Director, the managment level with security manager,Operation Manger, Service Manager, Innovation manager, Architecture manger   and the level of technicians, administrators, engineers and developers.


---
## Query the table "EMPLOYEE"

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "d7c74aa8af"
disable_transition: true
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```sql
DESC EMPLOYEE
```{{1}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/248a6b7f2a40674527f8bf714392b801603b3c8d/descTable.png){{2}}


`@script`
With the knowledge of the organigramm of the company we want now to check the table "EMPLOYEE" where each employee and the organisation is saved. This we can do by use the command DESC like in Oracle DBs. In other SQL Server you could use different commands like describe. Applying this command on the table employee you can see that the table is organized by an ID, the name of the person, the job title and the ID of the employee's supervisor


---
## Query the table "Employee"

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "d5a47e5815"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
```sql
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
```{{1}}
![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/8a6417e8878924b4463c20378bfb41bc65fca8e9/dataTable.png){{2}}


`@script`
No we have to check the data. We select all entries of the table Employee to get all the data stored. As you can see we have here several entries of employes. We have for example one IT Director with the name Heinz Grießer or 2 Developers with the names Karin Pacher and David Fanzott, which are managed by Hannes Berg. What we now want to do is, to query the  table to get the employees hierarchy levels of the DataInsigthNow


---
## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "3d7930f567"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
Get the hierarchical level for each employee
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id, Name, Position, Level, ID_Supervisor) AS 
(
      SELECT
            Id,Name,Position,0,ID_Supervisor
      FROM
           Employee
      WHERE 
            ID_Supervisor IS NULL
      UNION ALL 
      SELECT
            emp.Id, emp.Name, emp.Position, Level + 1, emp.ID_Supervisor
      FROM
            Employee emp
      INNER JOIN hierarchy ON 
            emp.ID_Supervisor = hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy
	
```{{1}}


`@script`
To do this we have to use the with-query select as learned before. You can see now the query to be used. We create the CLT hierarchy with the union of the employees with no Manager with all other employess of the table Employee. we create the table hierarchy which can be selected as wanted. To get the hierarchy level of DataInsigthNow, we introduced the value Level. With this value we get the hierachy level of all employees. In our case this could be from 0 describing the IT Director to 2 for engineers and so on.

## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "5629db39ca"
```

`@part1`
The result:

`@part2`
The query:
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id, Name,Position,
Level,ID_Supervisor) AS 
( SELECT
     Id,Name,Position,0,ID_Supervisor
  FROM
     Employee
  WHERE 
     ID_Supervisor IS NULL
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT
     emp.Id, emp.Name, emp.Position,
Level + 1,emp.ID_Supervisor
  FROM
    Employee emp
  INNER JOIN hierarchy ON 
    emp.ID_Supervisor=hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy 
```


`@script`
Now let's have a look at the result of the query. As you can see each employee has its supervisor and its hierarchical level.

## Create the hierarchical query

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "ada8d76591"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
The result:

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/28af9c53939b84d0862e22a518cea53456037ca0/levelTableHighlighted.png)


`@part2`
The query:
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id, Name,Position,
Level,ID_Supervisor) AS 
( SELECT
     Id,Name,Position,0,ID_Supervisor
  FROM
     Employee
  WHERE 
     ID_Supervisor IS NULL
  UNION ALL 
  SELECT
     emp.Id, emp.Name, emp.Position,
Level + 1,emp.ID_Supervisor
  FROM
    Employee emp
  INNER JOIN OrganisationChart ON 
    emp.ID_Supervisor=hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy 
```


`@script`
The level is now highlighted with yellow.
We can see that we have one director, 5 employees in the managment level 1 and 6 employees in the engineering and development level 2. 
More over employee 3 has employee 1 as boss, employee 8 has employee 7 as boss and so on. 
This knowledge of the organization can be very usefull and it is quite easy to be done by hierarchical queries. Let's practice more with hierarchical queries. we want to query all employess managed by an specific employee.

## Get hierarchy for one employee

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "1204caa93e"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
Get all employees managed by employee with the ID 4:
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id,Name,Position,Level,
ID_Supervisor,Root) AS
(   SELECT
         Id,Name,Position,0,ID_Supervisor,Id
    FROM
         Employee
    WHERE 
         ID_Supervisor IS NULL
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT
         emp.Id,emp.Name,emp.Position,
Level+1,emp.ID_Supervisor, Root
    FROM
         Employee emp
    INNER JOIN hierarchy ON 
         emp.ID_Supervisor = hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy 
WHERE Root = 4
```{{1}}


`@script`
To do so we have to modify the query as described here. We add the value root which corresponds to the top-most supervisor of each employee. Doing so, we can now query all employees managed by the employee with ROOT ID 4

## Get hierarchy for one employee

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "05e1b918d4"
```

`@part1`
The result:

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/d9ced29d1f5b23f81c4550405db9115064d475ec/rootTable.png){{1}}


`@part2`
The query:
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id,Name,Position,Level,
ID_Supervisor, Root) AS
(   SELECT
     Id,Name,Position,0,ID_Supervisor,Id
    FROM
     Employee
    WHERE 
     ID_Supervisor IS NULL
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT
     emp.Id,emp.Name,emp.Position,
Level+1,emp.ID_Supervisor, Root
    FROM
     dbo.Employee emp
    INNER JOIN hierarchy ON 
     emp.ID_Supervisor = hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy 
WHERE Root = 4
```


`@script`
Now let us have a look on the result of the query. You can see we have now the new value Root in our output

## Get hierarchy for one employee

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "19d8c90d9c"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
The result:

![](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4213/datasets/2b83c560cbeb7b056815b068ca74514a1d25a488/rootTableHighlighted.png)


`@part2`
The query:
```sql
WITH hierarchy (Id,Name,Position,Level,
ID_Supervisor, Root) AS
(   SELECT
     Id,Name,Position,0,ID_Supervisor,Id
    FROM
     Employee
    WHERE 
     ID_Supervisor IS NULL
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT
     emp.Id,emp.Name,emp.Position,
Level+1,emp.ID_Supervisor, Root
    FROM
     dbo.Employee emp
    INNER JOIN hierarchy ON 
     emp.ID_Supervisor = hierarchy.Id
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy 
WHERE Root = 4
```


`@script`
As before the new value ROOT is highlighted in yellow.
You can see that the employee 4 has the 2 employees Anna Kruggel and Karin Pacher to manage. This could be done for each employee like you want.
So we have now seen how we could apply hierarchical queries to a data table, but now it is time that you pratice and that you implement such queries on your own

## Let's practice!

So have fun and let's practice!
